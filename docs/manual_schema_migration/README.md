# Slack API specs

The OpenAPI definitations here are taken from the [Official Slack API Specs](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs) on github.

They're then converted to OpenAPI v3 using the online [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) tool, exported as yaml and then any minor remaining linting issues are fixed.
